        <h3>Service Plans:</h3>
        <p>
          You may order Services by submitting Plan Orders through the iGeek Care
          Websites or by calling iGeek Care. Once iGeek Care accepts the Plan Order
          submitted by you, then you will receive an email from iGeek Care at the
          email address that you provide or have provided to iGeek Care as part of the
          Registration Process for the Services. iGeek Care is not responsible for
          rendering Services in connection with any Plan Order that it has not
          accepted. Upon acceptance by iGeek Care of a Plan Order, you will have a
          Service Plan.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Undertaking:</h3>
        <p>
          Subject to the Terms and Conditions, and other terms specific to each
          Service Plan, iGeek Care will address your query using commercially
          reasonable efforts in providing appropriate solutions under the Services. In
          most cases, iGeek Care will attempt problem diagnosis and a solution through
          chat, email or other means as it deems most appropriate under the
          circumstances including remote access. You understand that if remote access
          is used on your computer there will be no residual software from the remote
          session; however, there may be a text file placed on your computer that will
          explain the work that was done on your computer. If such a text file is
          placed on your computer, you have the option to either save the file for
          future reference or to delete it from your computer. All undertakings under
          Service Plans are subject to iGeek Care’s.
          <br />
          <br />
          Limited Warranty, which is set forth below. You agree to pay all Services
          Fee and any other applicable fee/charges as set out in the relevant Plan
          Order in accordance with the Payment Terms provided below.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Payment:</h3>
        <p>
          Services against any Plan Order will be available once you have made payment
          for Services according to the requirements of the corresponding Plan Order.
          iGeek Care has no obligation to render Services under any Service Plan if
          the payments as required under any Plan Order have not been made. You
          understand that certain Service Plans may have fee including, but not
          limited to “Service Fee” and/or “Activation Fee” payable either on an annual
          basis (“Annual Payment Plan”) or on a monthly basis (“Recurring Payment
          Plan”). Subject to the applicable Term Plan, all payments under the Annual
          Plan shall be made upfront at time of commencement of the subscription
          cycle.
          <br />
          <br />
          For payments under the Recurring Payment Plan, apart from the monthly
          installments of the Service Fee, payable over a one (1) year payment term,
          you may be charged an additional non-refundable Activation Fee at the time
          of registration, as specified in the Plan Order. The fee (including
          Activation Fee) will not be refunded in case of cancellation of the Service
          Plan unless otherwise stated in the Plan Order.
          <br />
          <br />
          All fee under this clause or a relevant Plan Order, is payable at the time
          of commencement of the Service Plan. When you purchased the Service, you
          agreed to a specific price and plan, where such plan maybe for a term of
          one, two or three years (“Term Plan”). All terms of Service Fee and/or any
          other fee payable under any mode of payment for a Subscription shall be set
          forth in the applicable Plan Order. Similarly, some plans may offer a
          discount on the Service if you sign up for other iGeek Care services
          (“Bundle Discount”). You agree to maintain your Service and the bundled
          services for the applicable term. If you signed up for a Term Plan or a
          Bundle Discount,the price available with those plans is valid until one of
          the following occurs:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The Term Plan expires</li>
          <li>
            You drop one of the iGeek Care services you were required to purchase to
            receive the special rate as notified to iGeek Care
          </li>
          <li>
            You terminate the agreement/Service Plan before the expiry of the relevant
            term. Credit Card Billing
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You may be asked to provide us with a credit card number from a card issuer
          that we accept in order to activate your Service. You hereby authorize iGeek
          Care to charge and/or place a hold on your credit card with respect to any
          unpaid charges for Services or any related equipment. You authorize the
          issuer of the credit card to pay any amounts described herein without
          requiring a signed receipt, and you agree that these charges are to be
          accepted as authorization to the issuer of the credit card to pay any
          amounts described herein without requiring a signed receipt, and you agree
          that these charges are to be accepted as authorization to the issuer of the
          credit card to pay all such amounts. You authorize iGeek Care and/or any
          other company who bills products or services, or acts as billing agent for
          iGeek Care to continue to attempt to charge and/or place holds with respect
          to all sums described herein, or any portion thereof, to your credit card
          until such amounts are paid in full.
          <br />
          <br />
          You agree to provide iGeek Care with updated credit card information upon
          iGeek Care’s request and any time the information you previously provided is
          no longer valid.
          <br />
          <br />
          You acknowledge and agree that neither iGeek Care nor any iGeek Care
          affiliated company will have any liability whatsoever for any non-sufficient
          funds or other charges incurred by you as a result of such attempts to
          charge, and/or place holds on, your credit card. If you mistakenly provide a
          debit card number, instead of a credit card number, you authorize all
          charges described herein to be applied to such debit card unless and until
          you provide a credit card number. In the event you are enrolled, or later
          enroll, in an automatic payment or electronic funds transfer plan, you agree
          that all sums described herein may be charged, at iGeek Care’s option, to
          the account number provided for such automatic payment or electronic funds
          transfer plan.
          <br />
          <br />
          When payment is made by credit card or debit card, payment will also be
          subject to the terms and conditions established by the credit or debit card
          issuer. If charges cannot be processed through your credit card, or if your
          bank draft or electronic funds transfer is returned for insufficient funds,
          we may, at our discretion, charge you an additional
