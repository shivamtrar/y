                <strong>Member account, password and security:</strong>&nbsp;If any of
                the Services requires you to open an account, you must complete the
                registration process by providing us with current, complete and accurate
                information as prompted by the applicable registration form. You also
                will choose a password and a user name. You are entirely responsible for
                maintaining the confidentiality of your password and account.
                Furthermore, you are entirely responsible for any and all activities
                that occur under your account. You agree to notify iGeek Care
                immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach
                of security. iGeek Care will not be liable for any loss that you may

                losses incurred by iGeek Care or another party due to someone else using
                your account or password. You may not use anyone else’s account at any
                time, without the permission of the account holder.We prefer to keep

                <strong>Forgotten, Lost or Stolen Information:</strong>&nbsp;If you have
                forgotten your password, we provide a mechanism that e-mails your
                password to you. Since the “forgot my password” feature sends your
                password to the email address that you used for registration, do not use
                an email address that can be accessed by others that you would not want
                to see or change your iGeek Care account information.Always use caution
                when giving out any personally identifiable information about yourself
                or your children in any Communication Services. iGeek Care does not
                control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any
