      <h3>iGeek Care RESPONSE PROCESS</h3>
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a Customer &amp;/or SMB Contact requests service, our staff enters a
      trouble ticket into a tracking system http://helpdesk.igeekcare.com. The
      system automatically generates a ticket number and sends the customer an
      e-mail acknowledging that a trouble ticket has been created. Keep in mind
      the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Responses are provided during normal business hours.</li>
      <li>
        Timeframes represent a best effort; delays may occur when products must
        be ordered or vendors engaged.
      </li>
      <li>
        With equipment orders (e.g., laptops, smart phones), our staff is
        responsible for providing specs and quotes within the established
        response timeframe. The timing of equipment delivery is beyond our
        control.
      </li>
      <li>Problems may be resolved remotely.</li>
      <li>
        When computers and smart phones are off site, our staff may not be able
        to adhere to the published response times.
      </li>
      <li>
        Problems caused by issues not within our staff’s control, such as
        building electrical failures, will be addressed as quickly as possible
        but are not held to the response timeframe.
      </li>
    </ul>
